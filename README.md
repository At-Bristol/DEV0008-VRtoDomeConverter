# VR-to-Dome-Converter
An experimental app to transfer from equirectangular source, as used for VR to Dome

#Issues

  - The convertion is done on the graphics card, therefore if you dont have a graphics card it wont work,
    but it wont warn you!

  - The windows installer is a bit screwy. Starts the app and then restarts it for some reason

#TODO

   -Add ability to save settings

   -Add ability to export video

   -Add ability to keyframe values
